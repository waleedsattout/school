# school

Manage your students and their marks online.

This code is using Codeigniter, MD3, Bootstrap and some sample code from Codepen.

All of it is free so is this site.

It is designed for Syrian schools for now, and maybe I'll expand it for more countries.


  # ChangeLog:
  ## v1.0.0:
  - Delete <span color="hsl(0, 84.2%, 60.2%)">Home Controller</span> and make <span style="color:hsl(200, 98%, 39.4%)">Students Controller</span> is the default one.
  -

  ## ToDo List:
  - :white_check_mark: Finish initial release.
  -  :white_check_mark: Recreate Certificate page.
  - :ballot_box_with_check: Page to add multiple **students**, **marks** or even **subjects**
  - More soon.
