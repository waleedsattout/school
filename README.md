# School Management

## About

I am in charge of a school, so I needed to manage it easly and something that did some boring work for me, so I had to do is a website. 
I used `codeigniter 4`, `material web`, `bootstrap` and some other cool stuff from all over the internet, I just forgot where I got them, so their credits to them.

## License

This is a free project, you may use it in any way you want just mention me so I have some Networks and expand my experience.

## Requirements

- Php
- Composer (php)
- Apache
- Web browser

You may want to use `xampp`, it helps a lot.

## How to use

- Clone this repo
- Download those packages from composer
    - codeigniter 4
    - PhpSpreadsheet
- Go to your database, make one called `school` and import its data from `school.sql`
- Make all adjustments needed to your situation in `.env` file
- You are good to go.

There are some files in `public` folder, some files and functions that you need to make your own version of them, because I made them for my situation. You still can use them if you want.

## Final words

- If you have any problems just call me, send a message, open an issue and I am happy to help you out.
- I may forget to mention something or edit, delete or add some neccessary things, so tell me if you have any problems.
- You may say that where is `v1`? I just forgot to publish it when I hade finished it, and fixed the codes and made a lot of changes to `v2` without saving the old code. My mistake.
- It is designed for Syrian schools for now, and maybe I'll expand it more in the future.
